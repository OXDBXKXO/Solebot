# Solebot

This project has been realized as part of the selection process for an internship in sold-out.io, a start-up which
aims to rebalance chances between fans of limited edition sneakers. Indeed, current market is dominated by expensive
bots that offer unfair advantage to their users, by allowing them to buy hundreds of pairs, as limited releases follow
the "first come, first serve" rule. Sold-out provides a bot for everyone to use.

# How to use the bot

Run main.py and use the menu. Currently only the Solebox part comes with a menu, but Snipes.fr is almost ready
